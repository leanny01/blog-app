# blog-app
I wrote this app to understand Sails.js better.

## A monolith approach

I have built this app with a monolith approach in mind. I needed the fastest way to deliver the upcoming project.

- View Layer: `React.js`, `Tailwind css`
- Backend: `Sails.js`
- Database:`Mongo.js`

## Setup

```
# Get the latest stable release of Sails
$ npm install sails -g
```

```
# clone the app 
$ git clone https://github.com/leanny01/blog-app.git

# cd into the new folder
cd blog-app
```

```
# fire up the server
sails lift
```
